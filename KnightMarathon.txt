This is answer of https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/14998 question

I make two kinds of knight marathon.
First one judge the cross line between start location and capital. Those points can express as right triangle.
It compares each diagonal line and knight's move every repetition. But this consume lots of memory.
So I make Second one.
It focus in pattern. In triangle, the long side is named as Yl, and the other is named as Xl. 
From the start location, Knight moves y side as 2, and x side as 1 until capital and current location become a right isosceles triangle.
After that, Knight can move y side 3 and x side 3 in two behavior.
We can find out the answer with some caculate.
But I need to look up exception more.

If we find the intersection of a straight line with slope 2 at the end point and a straight line with slope 1/2 at the start point, I thought that the number of movements would be the same as a result.
But not actually.
May be hybrid of first and second would be the answer.

I visualize move of the knight, and try to make some kind of structure.
I make 8 kinds of moves as array. Those moves make map 1 to 0, then sum of each column would change. It means knight moves within the allowed area.
I need to normalize more.
